# Sleep tracker website


This project is a fully functional and optimized web application that promotes holistic well-being by integrating three core wellness modules: a sleep tracker, a fitness routine checklist, and a mental health journal. Users can log and visualize their sleep hours with interactive graphs, manage personalized workout routines with built-in timers, and maintain a weekly mental health journal with mood tagging and charting. The application features a clean, classic UI/UX design, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience while encouraging consistency in self-care habits.
